1. **App Store Availability**
   - Search each name in App Store
   - Make sure no existing app with same/similar name
   - Avoid trademark conflicts

2. **Domain Availability**
   - Check .com, .app, .io availability
   - Having matching domain helps credibility
   - Use: namechk.com or instantdomainsearch.com

3. **Social Media Handles**
   - Check Twitter, Instagram, Facebook
   - Consistent branding across platforms
   - Use: namecheckr.com

4. **Trademark Search**
   - Check USPTO.gov (US trademarks)
   - Check IP India (Indian trademarks)
   - Avoid legal issues later

---

## Impact of Name Change

### Benefits:
- ✅ Better reflects multi-currency support
- ✅ More professional/brandable
- ✅ Better App Store discoverability
- ✅ Fresh start with branding

### Costs:
- ⚠️ Lose existing app reviews/ratings
- ⚠️ Lose existing users (need to notify them)
- ⚠️ Need to submit as new app
- ⚠️ Marketing from scratch

### Alternative: Keep Dollar2Rupee, Add Subtitle
Instead of fully renaming, you can update the subtitle to clarify multi-currency support:
- "Dollar2Rupee - Multi-Currency Remittance Comparison"
- "Dollar2Rupee - Compare Remittance Rates"

**Benefits:**
- Keeps your existing user base
- Retains all reviews and ratings
- Still improves discoverability
- No resubmission needed

---

## My Personal Recommendation

### If Starting Fresh:
**Choose:** "RemitCompare" or "XRate"
- **RemitCompare:** Professional, clear, trusted
- **XRate:** Modern, brandable, memorable

### If Keeping Current App:
**Update subtitle instead:**
- "Dollar2Rupee - Compare Remittance Rates"
- Keep your user base and reviews
- Still improves discoverability

### Best of Both Worlds - Gradual Transition:
1. Update subtitle now
2. Launch new app with new name
3. Cross-promote between apps
4. Eventually sunset old app

---

## Next Steps

Once you choose a name:
1. Verify App Store availability
2. Check domain and social media handles
3. Conduct trademark search
4. Update code and assets
5. Prepare new App Store listing
6. Plan marketing/announcement strategy
