## 📋 Review Notes

**For App Review Team:**

Dollar2Rupee is a rate comparison application, similar to:
- Kayak (flight comparison)
- Trivago (hotel comparison)
- NerdWallet (financial product comparison)

We are NOT a money transfer provider or financial institution. We do not process transactions. We display publicly available exchange rates and link to provider websites/apps.

The app uses SFSafariViewController to open provider websites, ensuring users see official Safari controls and know they're leaving our app.

We do not receive payment or commissions from providers (unless this changes - then disclosure will be added).

All deep links (URL schemes) in Info.plist are used solely to detect if user has provider apps installed, allowing us to offer direct app opening instead of website links.
